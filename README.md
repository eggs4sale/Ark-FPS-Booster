# Ark-FPS-Booster
This code should be used for low-end computers, the code will reduce lag you get from ark at the cost of the overall quality of how the game looks. Also allows you to see perfectly fine while drinking beer.

You would have to first find your in game files of Ark Survival Evolved which it should located somewhere like this \Steam\steamapps\common\ARK\Engine\Config.
Then once your in the Config file locate the ConsoleVariables.ini file.
After that delete everything thats inside the ConsoleVariables.ini, copy and paste the code inside the file.
Once your finished dont forgot to restart steam.

And thats pretty much it hope you enjoy :).
